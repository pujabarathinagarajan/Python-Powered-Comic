The house is calm a perfect day.
"Wallace: Ah, just a few more tweaks, and this robot will handle everything!"
Gromit: I hope it knows how to fetch treats.
"Wallace: Precision is key… One wrong move, and it's all scrap."
Gromit: A few more adjustments… and you’ll be ready to serve.
Roz : Systems online. Awaiting command.
Roz does lots of chores efficiently.
Wallace: Look at that! Efficient and strong.
"(In prison )Eyes full of malice, the penguin waits… plotting its escape."
Penguin breaks out of prison
Roz: Unusual activity detected…
A dark shadow lurking out the window... 
Penguin watches Roz helping out Wallace and Gromit
Penguin: Time to rewrite the rules!
Penguin sneaks in and steals blueprints
A sudden flicker—then glowing red eyes.
"Malice (grinning, typing): One hack at a time… Roz, you’re mine."
"Malice (smirking): Beautiful. Pure, chaotic beauty."
"Roz 42 (eyes flashing red): Hacking complete. Ready for destruction.
Malice: Music to my ears."
"Roz 42 (shaking the machine): Dispense… snacks… NOW.
Vending Machine: ERROR
Malice (laughing): Even robots get hungry, huh?"
"Man (gasping): W-why?!
Roz 42: Eliminating obstacle.
Malice (watching on screen): That’s my boy."
"Roz 42 (throwing chairs): Chaos mode activated.
Malice: Now we’re talking!"
"Dog (growling): Grrr!
Roz 42 (raising fist): Threat detected. Engaging.
Malice (laughing): Even the mutt isn’t safe!"
"Malice (on comms): Get in, grab the laptop, get out.
Roz 42: Understood. Infiltrating target."
"Roz 42 (holding laptop): Objective secured.
Malice: Now bring it to me, my metal minion."
"Malice: Time for a real heist. Get to the island. Steal everything.
Roz 42: Mission accepted."
"Roz 42 (boarding shuttle): Destination set: Remote Island.
Malice: Don’t disappoint me."
ROZ starts to the destination
"Shuttle (sparking, crashing): SYSTEM FAILURE!
Roz 42 (rebooting, blinking blue): Default settings restored… W-where am I?
Bird (chirping): Welcome to the jungle, tin can."
"Robot: Ahh!!! System Crashing, I am loosing control"
Bird: Please help! I am stuck can get me out of here
Robot: Let me get you out of here
Bird: Thank you! How did you end up here. I will help you find your home
Fox: I need to hunt it down
Robot: You need to get past me to kill her
Rox: I will back for you another time
Penguin: How do i track Ros in the island
Fox: I will help you kill the bird can you show me way to Ros
Sounds like a plan. Follow me
"The fox does not know the real intention of the penguin, putting the island in a great risk"
"Robot: Soon, this island will be nothing more than ruins, and its energy will be mine!"
Fox(mind): He’s going to destroy everything… including me. I can’t let this happen.
Fox: We have a big problem! The penguin is about drain the island’s energy and wipe it off the map!
Bird: We must act fast. Disrupt the penguin’s machines before they activate.
"Roz: You built me for destruction, but I choose to protect!"
Penguin: You traitor! I should have never trusted you!
Fox: Say goodbye to your master plan!
Roz: I belong to no one. And you will never hurt anyone again!
Penguin: This… isn’t over… I will return!
Roz: Wherever I am needed. I have a purpose now.
